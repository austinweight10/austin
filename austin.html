                      <p>As a little boy, my favorite thing in the world was Lego <!-- lego emoji --> I loved how I could create new worlds brick by brick and it sparked a life-long love of design. Now fully-fledged and grown-up, I have found an industry that requires the same skills. Fitting together lots of smaller blocks to create something wonderful.<br>
                      <br>My passion lies within performance driven design that is user tested. I suppose I enjoy this because analytics is the key to ensure statistically proven ideas are used to engage and advance business developments and break down concepts so they can be reused.<br>
                      <br>I aim to understand how designs are interacted with and how these behaviours can be affected and changed to best suit an end goal. This drives my real purpose as a designer and developer.<br>
                      <br>In my student days, I spent a lot of time studying emergent behaviors and design in complexity - a hobby outside of work as well as in. This has helped give me an understanding of how emergent behaviour can benefit development and design decisions. Not only did this ignite my appreciation for networks and development, but lead to a better understanding of the digital world.<br>
                      <br>As a developer, I am experienced in a number of CMS systems, particulary Magento and WordPress with WooCommerce, but really enjoy getting back to basics - pure Javascript/HTML and CSS like this.</p>
