                      <h3>About Me</h3>
                      <p>I am interested and skilled in designing and creating designs to drive performance and goals through user engagement. I relish creating fully tested and intelligent designs for campaigns that significantly uplift engagement. I enjoy analysis and analytics to ensure statistically proven ideas are used to engage and advance business developments. I believe understanding and gaining insights into how designs are interacted with and how these behaviours can be affected and changed to best suit an end goal is more important than creating unjustified decorative forms.
                      <br><br>I indulge in understanding how emergent behaviour and intelligence within crowds can be controlled and improved through intervention. I have a passion for networks and development, thus enjoy designing digitally. In my free time I constantly evolve my work and creative process within a variety of projects and relish when this allows me to experiment within different media platforms.
                      <br><br>a bit about me ... magento, wordpress, woocommerce, php, mysqtl, HTML email, </p>
